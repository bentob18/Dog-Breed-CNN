# Dog-Breed-CNN
Convolutional neural networks algorithm for a dog indetificantion app 
# Installation
In this project we are using Jupyter Notebook on Kaggle, that has Python v3.7.12. We are also using sobre librarys such as:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Tensorflow
# File descriptions
I used some images of the internet in PNG/JPG format to try to predict the dog breeds and to see if there was a human in the picture or not.
# About the project
This is a project from the Udacity Data Science Capstone Project, where you have to solve a real problem, and i choose to make a CNN for a dog identification app.
# Medium
I posted my technical analysis on my project and published it on Medium, check it out: https://medium.com/@paraobentinho/dog-breed-convolutional-neural-network-a257c459c06d
